# bootstrap-bg-transparency
Mixin for creating backgrounds for each color in Bootstrap at 10 different transparency levels.

This mixin and variables creates transparent backgrounds at 10 different transparency levels for all colours in the Bootstrap $colors map, found in the _variables.scss file. This allows backgrounds to be applied to any element using the class bg-{color}-{transparency}.

e.g. bg-blue-70 results in a background colour equal to the colour stored in the variable 'blue' with an alpha value of 0.7.
